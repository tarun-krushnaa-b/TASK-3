#Task 3

Develop a Power BI dashboard to analyze product performance across different regions and customer segments. This task will focus on applying calculated measures, conditional formatting, and advanced filtering.


Dataset Overview:
You will use a dataset with the following columns:
Product ID
Product Name
Category
Region
Sales Amount
Cost
Profit
Customer Segment
Date

Instructions:

Data Import and Preparation
Load the dataset into Power BI.
Create a new calculated column for Profit Margin using the formula:Profit Margin=ProfitSales Amount×100\text{Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Sales Amount}} \times 100Profit Margin=Sales AmountProfit×100
Ensure all columns are correctly formatted.

Visualizations
Create the following:

A clustered column chart showing Sales Amount by Region with color coding for Profit Margin. Use conditional formatting to highlight high and low margins.
A matrix showing Product Name, Category, Sales Amount, and Profit. Include subtotals and grand totals.
A card visual displaying the total Sales Amount.
Filters and Slicers
Add a slicer for Category.
Add a date range slicer for Date to analyze performance over a selected period.
Apply a visual-level filter to only show products with Profit Margin > 10%.

Formatting and Customization

Apply a color theme to make the dashboard visually consistent.
Use data labels where appropriate.
Add a title to your dashboard: "Product Performance Analysis."

Insights

Add a text box summarizing at least 2 insights based on your findings (e.g., products with the highest profit margin, regions contributing the most to sales).

Submission Guidelines:

Save your Power BI file as StudentName_ProductPerformance.pbix.
